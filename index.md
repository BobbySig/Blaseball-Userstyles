## Styles

### BIG SCREEN Blaseball

See all the matches/bets on screen at once with this BIG SCREEN experience. 
Attempts to show matches 2 rows of 5.

You may need to lower the zoom on your browser if you have a smaller screen.

Includes the [Windows 10 Emoji fix](#windows-10-emoji-fix).

There's a [changelog](changelog.html#big-screen-blaseball) for this style.

[Install Style](styles/big-screen-blaseball.user.css)


### Windows 10 Emoji fix

Makes monochrome emojis used by the Moist Talkers, Spies and Fridays visible
by making them black (okay, the Spies is not really _more_ visible, but definitely
more fitting, at least!)

This is already included in the [BIG SCREEN Blaseball](#big-screen-blaseball)
style, it's only needed if you want to fix this issue without
the BIG SCREEN experience.

There's a [changelog](changelog.html#windows-10-emoji-fix) for this style.
